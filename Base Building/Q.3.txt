A browser engine, also known as a layout engine or rendering engine, is a crucial component of a web browser. It's the underlying software responsible for interpreting and displaying web content. When you visit a website, the browser engine takes the HTML, CSS, and other code that makes up the webpage and renders it into the visual and interactive experience you see on your screen.

Here's how it works: When you enter a web address or click on a link, the browser engine fetches the necessary resources from the server, interprets the code, and then lays out the content on your screen. It handles tasks like parsing HTML to structure the webpage, interpreting CSS for styling, and executing JavaScript for dynamic and interactive elements.
